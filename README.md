# DeepCNN

*goal

Final goal is Image Processing by yolo v3

*model List

Before using yolo v3, I will study previous models so figure out what's diffrent between yolo v3 and previous models. The list of previous model is
 -CNN
 -yolo v1
 -SSD.
 
 After studying, I'll updload my v3 code.
 
*environment

(given by university gpu server)
GPU : NVIDIA Tesla p100 PCIe 16GB 
OS : Linux ubuntu 18.04
CUDA : 10.1
FrameWork : PyTorch - 1.1
Lang : Python - 3.7
Editor : PyCharm Professional

*Submission
 only code. Because I use gpu server served by university, couldn't upload whole project. So if you want to try, search 'CNN using Pytorch', 'install Pytorch on Ubuntu'. Then you could get information
 
 # CNN
 I follow some blog. If you follow what I uploaded, you could understand step of CNN
